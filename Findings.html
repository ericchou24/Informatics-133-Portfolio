						<h4>User Interviews</h4>
						<p>User interviews should not be something that one should skip on when trying to create something that should appeal to others. Since the main audience of an individual’s portfolio isn’t him/herself, the importance of having other people’s opinions and answers are critical to a portfolio’s success. The types of questions asked should focus primarily on interests and information someone would like to see. It should focus on main aspects and features to include, as well as what is important for the audience to see. You may also ask if your own thoughts and opinions on what to put into your portfolio are feasible.

						<h4>Competitor Analysis</h4>
						<p>Doing the competitor analysis allowed for me to get an idea of how portfolios are. That being the case, most of them have similarities, but the actual display and visuals are very different in itself. Most portfolios I viewed were very simplistic, yet anyone would be sure of how to navigate around the page. I got an idea and feel of how to make my portfolio through competitor analysis and also gained a lot of inspiration on what to include. Competitor analysis helped me think of what was actually important to include into my portfolio site.

						<h4>Feature Value Matrix</h4>
						<p>A feature value matrix helps an individual visualize and prioritize which features to implement into their portfolio. They are able to list their features and assign a value to the feature in respective categories. If the number is low, it means that the feature should be taking as a priority and of high importance. Using a feature value matrix can help an individual figure out which features are the most important to them.

					<div class ="col-xs-6">
						<h4>Feature Priorization</h4>
						<p>Using the feature value matrix’s scores, we determined the feature prioritization. We are able directly translate those scores and create a graph of which features have higher importance to be fulfilled. Feature prioritization directly translates into building an interface because the author is able to decide where to begin and where they should allocate more of their time into.

						<h4>User Stories</h4>
						<p>User stories help by letting the author visualize who their audience will be. It can help the author cater their work much more appropriately and display contents that the audience would like to see. This allows the author to cater to a specific audience, or think about specific content that a specific user would like to see. For example, if you created a user story for a hiring manager, you would expect them to be able to find your projects and previous work experience.

						<h4>Cognitive Walkthrough</h4>
						<p>The cognitive walkthrough lets the author observe and evaluate the usability of his/her website by asking users to perform a series of tasks and actions in the website. The author of the portfolio observes any usability flaws as well as strong points and takes notes of them. Any flaws should be addressed by the author. Doing the cognitive walkthrough proved to be the most useful andinsightful to me. What I expected to be a 10 minute conversation turned into over half an hour of constructive criticism and feedback on how to improve my portfolio’s aesthetics. There weren’t many challenges besides trying to keep up with all the information that I was being given. The only other challenge was that the responses I got differed drastically. This made choosing what to do a bit difficult, but I ended up choosing to follow the responses that provided the most feedback and logical reasoning. For my cognitive walkthroughs, I probably should have focused more on people who had careers, just like I did in my user research interviews. Choosing students seemed to get me weaker and shorter responses.

						<h4> Usability Tests</h4>
						<p>
							User test were made in order to test some features of usability in our portfolio. What I thought would have been easy and straight forward proved to pose a problem to many people who visited my site. For one, my navigation bar wasn’t that prominent since when asking users to navigate to a certain section; I had responses that clicked elsewhere, even a response that clicked on the browser’s scroll bar instead of the built-in navigation for the site. Another thing I got from it was that many people believed that my skills listed were all clickable buttons, when in reality; their only purpose is to list my skill without any interaction. I personally found this test to have both pros and cons. Cons being that you can't necessarily extract too much information and thoughts from the users, but the pros are that there can be a large number of people who respond, even if their responses are not very insightful, you can still use that data to adjust your page.

					<h1>Summary of Findings</h1>
					<p>I had a lot of findings as well as insightful information presented to me by doing both the user research and the user testing. However, what benefitted me the most in progressing my portfolio was the cognitive walkthrough. Having someone actually view your sight with actions end to end allows the author to see first-hand what kind of website he/she has designed. I found that my most effective cognitive walkthrough wasn’t simply me asking the user to perform an action. The most effective and insightful walkthrough was more like an actual conversation. I received constructive criticism for each question asked, sometimes I never even asked and I still received feedback, which was extremely beneficial to my findings. 
						<br>
						<br>
					The findings that I found not too helpful were when people would just give me bland responses and say that everything looks fine. It was also hard to get insightful feedback at times because the users being interviewed didn’t completely understand why they felt a certain way either. For example, someone expressed that they disliked the color scheme, but without any reason behind it, while my most effective interview provided me with reasons such as seeing too many solid colors at a single point without any smooth transitions.</p>

				<h1>Incorporation of Findings</h1>
				<p>From my findings, I got a lot of insightful ideas and advice on how to make my portfolio better. One thing I am changing for sure is the color scheme. I was originally dividing my sections up by colored background, but from my cognitive walkthrough, I got feedback saying that it was weird seeing multiple colors of different lengths sections at one page. Since each section has its own length, I was recommended to do some kind of a gradient for my background. I believe having a gradient is an excellent idea and immediately changing my web's background felt like a dramatic improvement.  However, this means that I need to change my picture because I edited it to have the same website background as the section.  Now that it is a gradient, I need to figure out a new way to get the picture to match with the background, or just simply change to another picture.
					<br>
					<br>
				Another thing that I will be incorporating into my project is a better navigation bar that will be static at the top of the screen to allow for site-wide navigation. Originally I was going to put a “back to top option,” but after a cognitive walkthrough, I decided that the static navigation bar would be enough to allow users to navigation freely throughout the page. I also got comments about the picture, which is cropped to very poor quality. It was mentioned that you can still see pixels around the corner of the picture, which makes the website seem cheaply made. This however, is something that I will be handling later since I do not have any good looking pictures currently.</p>
